Summary: A (copied) design of a dual power supply circuit for arduino nano and an nRF24L01 transceiver module
---


This is my version of a dual power supply for arduino and the nRF24L01+ transceiver module.

I have read that the nRF24L01 transceiver module may behave erratically if its power supply (3.3V) is not stable.  I also have a base module for it, but I plan to only use the base module during the initial testing.

If and when I use these transceiver, I would prefer minimize the number of components.  

Hopefully, I can fabricate the PCB these following nights.  

Most of my circuits would be through-hole, as opposed to surface mount technology/devices (SMT or SMD).
